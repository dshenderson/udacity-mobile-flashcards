# Mobile Flashcards
This is the Mobile Flashcards project for the React Native portion of Udacity's React Nanodegree program.

The user is able to create a series of "Decks" and "Cards". Each Card in a Deck contains a question and an answer.
The user is shown the question, then can toggle or "flip" the card to see the answer. The user then indicates whether
the question was answered correctly, and after all the Cards in the Deck have been reviewed, a score is shown. Additionally,
a daily notification is set up to remind the user to study.

## Setup

First, clone the project from GitHub. After that, you've got choices. I used Expo, and I suggest you do, too, for
convenience. As the React Native landscape is constantly changing, I won't give any further instructions here, as they
are bound to be out of date before I even commit this README to the repo.

I've run this app on an Android, as that's what I've got. Mileage may vary.
